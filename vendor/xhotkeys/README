xhotkeys - Bind keys and mouse events to commands in the X-Window

*** Author

	Tokland <arnau@ehas.org>

*** Motivation

	Some desktop environments have their own hotkey launcher utilitity. 
	This is nice, but also has a serious problem: if you change the 
	environment, you have to reconfigure all the hotkeys (disgusting!). 
	It's better to have a utility that do this task separately.

*** How to install

- Go to xhotkeys source directory and just:

	make install
	
	...
	
	with Debian, better create the package:
	
		make dist-deb
		dpkg -i ../xhotkeys_VERSION_all.deb

You need the "imagemagick" package installed.	

- Configure your X Desktop environment to run "xhotkeys" at startup. For 
  example, with GNOME: 
	 
	 - System-> Preferences -> Sessions
	 - StartUp Programs -> Add 
	 - StartUp Command: xhotkeys (Order: 50)

*** How to configure

	Take a look at the manpage (man xhotkeys), but basically:

	xhotkeys --config

*** Specificacions

	- Python 2.3 with PyXlib, PyGlade and PyGTK libraries 
	- User configuration file in $HOME/.xhotkeys 
	- Pidfile for each hotkey daemon: $HOME/.xhotkeys.pid-$USER 
	- Daemon reloads configuration with SIGHUP signal

*** Why Python?

	Python is a multiplataform dynamic object-oriented language. It's easy 
	to learn and *very* funny to use. With Python you spend your time 
	programming instead of fighting with the language itself. Moreover, 
	it has tons of modules and add-ons. Wrappers for the most popular C
	libraries are often available. Take a look at http://www.python.org.

*** Pluses

	- Developed in Python: compact, easy to understand and modify.
	- In addition to keys, it recognizes mouse events.
	- Graphical GTK-configuration.
	- Recognizes all (eight) modifiers, not only the typical Ctrt, Alt and Shift.
	- Configuration files can be changed manually.

*** Minuses:

	Devoloped in Python :-). Scripting languages are big memory eaters (also
	CPU, but not important for this kind of utilities), far more than compiled C 
	applications. Although a C version of the daemon would be nice, it's 
	not a urgent task for now.
