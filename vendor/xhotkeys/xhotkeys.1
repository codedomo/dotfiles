.TH "xhotkeys" "1" "" "Arnau Sanchez" "X11"
.SH "NAME"
xhotkeys \- Bind keys and mouse events to commands in the X-Window
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBxhotkeys\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The purpose of \fIxhotkeys\fR is to provide a simple and easy configurable 
hotkey launcher for the X-Window System, independent from the desktop 
(Gnome, KDE, Xfce, ...) used.
.PP
Although \fIxhotkeys\fR has a graphical GTK+ configurator, it's possible to 
manage configuration files manually.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
The \fIxhotkeys\fR daemon should be run after X user logs in. All desktop 
interfaces provide (or should provide) a way to do this automatically (for example, 
Gnome has the Startup Programs at Sessions). Take a look on the 
documentation.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \\-h | \\-\\-help
Displays the help message and exit
.TP

.B \\-v | \\-\\-verbose
Increase the level of verbosity (0: error, 1: info, 2: debug)
.TP

.B \\-c | \\-\\-config
Start GTK+ configurator
.TP

.B \\-f | \\-\\-configuration\\-file \fI configuration_file\fR
Alternative configuration file

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
By default, \fI$HOME/.xhotkeys\fR would be used. Any line beggining with \fI#\fR is ignored. 
Hotkeys are defined that way:

.nf 
name=[<modifier1>][<modifier2>][<modifierN>]key:command
.fi 

Hotkey names cannot use \fI=\fR character. 

Available modifiers are: \fIshift\fR, \fIcontrol\fR, \fIalt\fR, \fIwinkey\fR, \fIaltgr\fR, 
\fIlock\fR, \fImod2\fR and \fImod3\fR. Available keys are all the strings defined 
in \fImiscellany\fR and \fIlatin1\fR Xlib source files. Both modifiers and
keys are case-insensitive. Moreover, you can define some special \fIkey\fR values: 

.nf 
\fI@DIGIT@\fR meaning keycode = DIGIT (use for keys without X-name)
.PP
\fIButtonX\fR meaning a mouse button (where X=1..5) 
.fi 
.PP 

.B Examples:

.nf 
  Calculator=<control><alt>F1:xcalc
  Eyes=<control><winkey>Button3:xeyes
  Window's Info=<alt><shift>@103@:xwininfo
.fi 

.SH "FILES"

.TP 5

String definitions for control keycodes.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
\fIUSER\fR and \fIHOME\fR are used to get username and user's home path.

.SH "SIGNALS"
\fISIGHUP\fR makes the hotkey daemon to reload the configuration file and continue 
running.

Some ideas were taken from \fIkeylaunch\fR (Ken Lynch and Stefan Pfetzing). Without their 
code this utility would have been painful to program.
