# Configuration file for xhotkeys

# You can edit this file by hand, but it's easier to 
# use the GTK+ graphical configurator: xhotkeys --config.

# Syntax: 
# name=[<modifier1>][<modifier2>]...[<modifierN>]key:command

# Allowed *modifiers* (case-insensitive) are: "Alt", "Control", "AltGr", 
# "Winkey", "Lock", "Mod2" and "Mod3" 

# Some *key* names are obvious, others are not, take a look at these files:
# /usr/lib/python@VERSION@/site-packages/Xlib/keysymdef/latin1.py 
# /usr/lib/python@VERSION@/site-packages/Xlib/keysymdef/miscellany.py 

# Note: remove leading "XK_" from keynames. For instance: XK_F1 -> F1
# As the modifiers, keys are also case-insensitive.

# Speacial keys:
# Mouse buttons: Button1, Button2, ...., Button5
# Keys withough X-name: @KEYCODE@ (you can check the code value with xev)

# examples:

# Calculator=<control><alt>C:xcalc
# Eyes=<control><winkey>Button3:xeyes
# Window Capture=<alt><shift>@103@:xwnd
